# HTPC Control

Most recorded sound and music is recorded with the intent that it will be played back on loudspeakers. It is for this reason that listening to music on headphones or earphones does not yield the effect desired by the audio engineer who preformed the final mix on the recording. The audio engineer performing the mixing most likely was using speakers to monitor the sound while making changes. When we listen to this music with headphones or earphones, the paths of the sounds are isolated, and crosstalk is eliminated. As well, the effects of the listenerâ€™s body are eliminated. By processing the recorded sound, we can artificially induce these effects so that the music will sound as though it is coming from loudspeakers, and not headphones or earphones.
